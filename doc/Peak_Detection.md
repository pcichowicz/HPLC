## Baseline correction

Ideally running a blank HPLC should result in a steady zero/near zero abosrbance during the entire HPLC run, but in reality there are many factors that disrupt this baseline. These factors cause "noise" that can impact the final analysis of HPLCs, such as but not limited to:
 -  Maintenance of the HPLC valves, flow cells, and UV detectors
 -  Temperature fluctuations of the laboratory during the day
 -  Mobile phase mixing
 -  Mobile phase degassing
