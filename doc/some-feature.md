# High-Performace Liquid Chromatography

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a analytical technique that is able to separate compounds in a chemical mixture. This technique uses high pressure pumps to deliever the mixture that contains solvents (mobile phase) where it flows through the system which is then collected into a cylinder/column that is filled with solid particles made from absorbent
material. The various solvents interact differently with the absorbent material, restulting in different migration rates for each component which allows for "separation" and using a specific detector to store this information. The output of the detector and software is a graph called a Chromatogram, a graphical representation of the singal intensity versus time as peaks which represent 
individual components of the sample. Each component has its own respective time on the graph called "rentention time", and the area underneath the curve is proportional to the concentration present in the mixture.
